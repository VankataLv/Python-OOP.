# 1.Single Responsibility:
# Each class is responsible for only one thing and should have only one reason to change
# 2.Open/Closed:
# Software entities like classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications
# 3.Liskov Substition:
# Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types
# Correct Polymorphism; Child classes ONLY extend functionalities of the Parent class and
# must not remove anything from Parent behavior
# 4.Interface Segregation:
# A client should not depend on methods it does not use -> this is done by separation through multiple inheritance
# This is done by Mixins
# 5.Dependancy Inversion:
